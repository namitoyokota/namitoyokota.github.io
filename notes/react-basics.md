# React Basics

- React.js is a JavaScript library for Singie- age applications
- Companent-baced architeture : build softmare based on reusable components us code
- Reusable: used multiple times and easily inserted anywhere where needed
- Independent: components cun exist within the Same Space independently from each other
components: Stand alone parts of the ul
- JSX: Syntar entension to Javascript
- Transpiling: interpreting a programming language and translating it to a specific target language
- State: the valves of all variables your app is working with at any given point
- Modules: Stand-alone unite or code that you can reuse
- React props: pass data between components
- Pure function: always returns the same output for the same argument values
- JSX allows developes to write HTML directly inside JavaScript
- Embedied expressions: allow Javascript values to be inserted into HTML of React element
- Hooks: functions that let you hook into Reart State and lifercie features from components
- State: data in a component that determines benavior
- usestate hook enables use of components for controlling state
- Prop drilling: State where data is passed down through multice layers as components
- Context APl allows data to be send without drilling
- Contert provider component that stores the state
- Contest Consumer: component that uses the provider's state
- Stateless comprent: state is not needed to work
- Stateful component: state must be maintained to work
- Website navigation: browse innough various pages or linies from a single component
- React Router: a library that gives you more control over the routing as components
- Keys identify changed, added, or remored list items and instruct treatment or elements when updates happen
- Value: a special property to determine input content
- Controlled components: components state handles form data
- uncontrolled companents: DoM handles form data
- Props and State: Plain JavaScript objects that React uses to hold information
- Props drilling problem: Passing data through all component tree levels even components that do not need it
- Context API is an alternative way to pass data. It is useful for gional state
- Side effect makes a Function impure
- Pure functions have no side effects while impure functions do have side effects.
- pure function returns the same output
- Rules for using React Hooks:
    - Only call nooks from a React component function
    - Only call nooks at the too lever
    - call Multiple state or ptlect hooks
    - Make Multiple hook culls in the same sequence
- UseReducer takes the intial state or the varian as wen
as a reducer function
- containment refers to the fact that some components
dont knew their children ahead us time
- Specialization defines components as being "Special cases" of other components
- Rendor props: take function that return Reat elementa and call them inside their render logic
- Jest: Javascript test funner whieh provides acess to isdom
- React Testing Library: set or utilities designed to fulfill testing best practices
