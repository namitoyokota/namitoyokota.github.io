# Foundations of User Experience

## Tips

- Go in order, take notes as you go
- Go at your own pace
- Set up Figma (will create 2 projects)
- Can be displayed on LinkedIn

## Foundations of User Experience Deisgn

- Coined by Don Norman (1990s) “UX”
- How the user **feels** is UX
- Product is a good/service/feature
- Good: Usable, equitable, enjoyable, and useful
- **Empathy** is key - understand how they think
- Interaction designer, visual, motion (transition), graphic designers, VR designer
- Colleagues: researchers, writers, production, engineers, program managers, conversation designer
- Tools: Sketch (2010), InVision/Zeplin → Figma/XD (2016)
- **Product dev lifecycle**: process to take product from an idea to reality
- Stages: brainstorm, define, design, test, and launch
- Don wrote “design of everyday things” (Dorman Doors)
- Responsibilities: research, create wireframes, create prototypes, information architecture, communication
- **Generalist**: broad responsibilities (also known as horizontal)
- **Specialist**: dive into one particular role (also known as vertical)
- **T-shaped**: specializes in one, breadth of knowledge for all
- **Startup**: new business with a unique idea
- **Freelance**: work for yourself
- **Advertising agencies**: creatives hired by clients
- **Internship**: short-term job with few responsibilities
- **Apprentenship**: on the job training
- **Entry-level job**: no prior experience required

## Thinking like a UX designer

- Universal design: process of creating one product for wide userbase (one size fits all)
- Inclusive design: take into account personal identifiers (solve for one, extend to many)
- Accessibility: design of products for people with disabilities
- Equality: same opportunity
- Equity: same outcomes
- Equity-focused design: think to be accessible for all
- Platform: medium that user experience your product on
- Brand identity: visual appearance and voice of company
- Responsible web design: allows website to change size on device
- Users behave differently on each device
- User-centered design: puts the user front-end-center
- User-centered process: understand, specify, design, and evaluate
- Iteration: doing something again, buidling on previous
- User: a person who is trying to solve a problem
- User experience: jouney the user takes
- Questions to research: disabilities, familiarity, access, where and when they use, is that all users?
- Assistive Technology (AT): any product that enhance prople with disabilities
- Example ATs: color modification, voice control, screen readers, alternative text, switch devices
- Switch: AT device that replaces keyboard/mouse
- When UX is good, you won’t know. Only bad you notice.

## Joining design sprints

- Framework: Cenceptual tool that provide guidance on best practices and processes for solving problems and building solutions that solve real user problems
- Design thinking framework: user-centered approach to problem-solving (research, prototyping, and testing)
- Design thinking phases: empathize, degine, ideate, prototype, test
- This is iterative and not linear process
- Business requirements come from whatever entity assigns the project
- Business goals: user to target, outcomes, vision or look
- Business parameters: budget, timeline, scope, tools, standard
- Good UX designers consider business requirement at each stage
- Method for empathize, interviews, empathy maps, user personas
- Empathy maps: who is the user, whay they say, what they think, what they do before/after what they feel
- Tools to define: user stories, user journeys, problem statements
- User story: one sentence (who, what, why)
- User journey: series of experience to achieve their goal
- Problem statement: who, what, why
- Ideate phase is about getting creative and brainstorming
- “How might we” HMW
- Techniques: HWS, rapid sketching, competitive audits, SCAMPER (substitude, combine adapt, modify, put, eliminate, rearrange), and collaboration
- Prototyping practices: information architecture and sitemaps, wireframing, paper wireframes, digital wireframes, low-fidelity prototypes, high-fidelity prototypes
- Design sprint: time-bound process with 5 phases (5 days with 8 hours per day)
- Goal of design sprint: solve problem through phases with users
- Phases: understand, ideate, decide, prototype, test
- Benefits: about the user, value people on team, best ideas to top, time to focus, lower risks, versitile scheduling
- Plan design sprints: research, call experts, find right space, gather supplies, establish rules, plan introductions, post-sprint planning (documentation)
- Sprint brief: a document that you share with all your attendees to help them prepare for the sprint
    - Challenge, key deliverables, logistics, approvers, resources, project overview, sprint schedule
- Sprint leader: person who sends brief to the team
- Retrospective: a collaborative critique of team’s design sprint
- Questions: what went well, what to improve

## Integrating research into design process

- UX research important in emmpathize and define phases
- UX research focuses on understanding user behaviors, needs, and motivations through observation and feedback
- Foundational research answers what to build, what are the user’s problems, how can we solve them?
- Design research answers the question how should we build it?
- Post-launch research answers did we succeed?
- Type of user research: foundational, design, post-launch
- Qualities of good UX researcher:
    - Empathy: able to understand someone’s thoughts/feelings
    - Pragmatism: focused on reaching goals
    - Collaboration: ability to work with ragne of people/work styles
- Foundation research is done before design
- Design research is done while you design
- Post-launch research is done after the design/launch
- Foundation research methods: interviews, surveys, focus groups, competitive audit, field studies, diary sturies
- Design research methods: A/O testing, cafe or guerilla studies, card sorting, intercepts
- Post-launch research methods: A/B testing, usability studies, surveys, log analytics
- Methods: how you get research done
- Primary research: research that you conduct yourself
- Secondary research: research that uses information someone else put together
- Data can be collected 2 ways: quantitative and qualitative
- Quantitative research: focus on data that can be gathered by counting or mesuring
- Qualitative research focuses on observation about why and how things happen
- Interviews: research method used to collect in-depth information on people’s opinions, thoughts, experiences, and feelgs
- Surveys: active where many people are asked the same questions in order to understand what most people think about a product
- Usability study: technique to evaluate a product by testing it on users
- Key performance indicaotrs (KPIs): critical measures of progress toward an end goal
- Secondary research benefits: save time/energy, immediately accessible, back up primary research
- Secondary research drawbacks: no first-hand user interaction, no specific user feedback
- Interview benefits: understand what users think and why, ask follow up questions
- Interview drawbacks: take time & money
- Survey benefits: large sample size, fast, inexpensive
- Survey drawbacks: no in-depth feedback
- Usability studies benefits: first hand interaction, challenge our assumptions, in-depth feedback
- Usability studies drawbacks: only measure how easy a product is to user, expensive, difference in lab use versus real life
- Kinds of biases: confirmation, false consensus, primary, recency, impliciti, sunk cost fallacy
- Bias: favoring or having prejudice against something based on limited information
- Confirmation bias: occurs when you start looking for evidence to prove a hypothesis you have
- Overcoming confirmation bias: ask open-ended questions, actively listen, include a large sample of users
- False consensus bias: overestimate the number of people who will agree with our idea or design
- Overcoming false consensus bias: identify/articulate assumptions, survey large groups of people
- Recency bias: it’s easiest to remeber the last thing you heard
- Overcoming recency bias: take detailed notes
- Primacy bias: remeber the last participant most strongly
- Overcoming primary bias: take detailed notes, interview each participant the same way
- Implicit bias: collection of attributes and steretypes we associate to people without our soncious knowdlege
- Overcoming implicit bias: reflect on our own behaviors, ask others to point out our implicit biases
- Sunk cost fallacy: the deeper we get into a project we’re interested in, the harder it is to change courses
- Overcoming sunk cost fallacy: break project into phases, outline points where you can decide to continue/stop
- Preventing bias in data collection
    - Choose your words carefully
    - Foster independent thinking
    - Avoid specific language
    - Limit the guidance you give users
    - Consider user’s tone and body language
    - Be careful of your own body language & reactions
    - Plan your research effectively
    - Remain open minded
